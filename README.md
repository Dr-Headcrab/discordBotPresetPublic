What Is This?

This is one of my modified Red Bot Applications made for my commonly used discord bots. I do not own the original RED application that has made this setup possible found in this repository, most of it is using third party cogs alongside my own few cogs to apply some special communication features. Visit cogs.red for more information regarding RED. Feel free to use and modify this as much as you please without my permission or credit.

Please visit https://twentysix26.github.io/Red-Docs regarding the original source, this is merely just a pre-configured version with custom modifications.

How Does It Work?

Like other RED bot applications, it requires Python 3 to run via a terminal window on both Windows and Linux. As long as all the important Python3 libraries and dependencies are installed, you can boot the bot up in terminal with 'python3 launcher.py'. As long as everything is installed and configured correctly, you can boot your bot up straight from the terminal thanks to the work already done by RED. Because this is a modular bot you can get install different tools and utilities for the bot from cogs.red.

How Do I set it up?

1. Make sure the latest build of Python 3 is installed (https://www.python.org/getit/)
2. download and unzip the file included in this repository 
3. open the folder and go to 'Red-DiscordBot/data/red/settings.json'
4. replace the "owner" value with your discord ID (remove the brackets) https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-
5. replace the "token" value with the token of the bot found in discordapp.com/developers/applications/me (also remove brackets)
6. save the file and open a terminal at the 'Red-DiscordBot' folder
7. type 'python3 launcher.py' to boot up the bot

These steps have been tested to work since July 2018 but could go out-of-date or broken in the future. Don't be afraid to ask me for help if you run into an issue or something broke.

[REMINDER: I did not create the original RED bot, this is simply a modified preset that can be used for anyone's intention of getting started in Discord bot development. I am not responsible for any damage that a user might intentionally bring to anyone with this bot.]
